## De novo genome assembly from NGS sequencing reads

Short reads from a NGS sequencing project were assembled into a complete genome using the shortest common superstring algorithm.
Using index-assist, the performance of the assembly algorithm was improved ~10X, from ~30 min to ~3 min.

Coding in Python is show in [this IPython/Jupyter notebook.][1]
